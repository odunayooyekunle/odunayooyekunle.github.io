            <p>The Earth is warming up. Both land and oceans are getting warmer now than
               record-keeping in 1880, and the temperatures are still going upward.
               This rise in temperature is called global warming. Most of these climate 
               changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that change
               the amount of solar energy our planet receives. These climate warming are also
               due to human activities.Sea levels are rising and oceans are becoming warmer.
                Longer, more intense droughts threaten crops, wildlife and freshwater supplies.
                 From polar bears in the Arctic to marine turtles off the coast of Africa, our
                  planetâ€™s diversity of life is at risk from the changing climate. </p>

                      <p class="text-center">Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
                          which act as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. The predominant factors
                           resulting in the warming of the earth are the emissions of CO2 and deforestation. CO2,
                            which damages the ozone layer, comes from several sources, but the most problematic are
                             those coming from the burning of fossil fuels from power plants. This releases thousands 
                             of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. Another cause of these emissions is the
                              burning of gasoline for transportation, which continues to grow because of our demand for
                               ars and also our increasing worldwide consumption, resulting in an escalating need to
                               transport goods. Also, forests store large amounts of carbon, so deforestation is causing
                                 larger amounts of CO2 to remain in the atmosphere. Humans are also to blame for this issue.</p>

                        <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk,
                            ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are
                            flowering sooner. Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate
                            change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.

                        <p>To stop this global issue of global warming we must all work togwther, and we must significally 
                            reduce the amount of heat trapping emmissions that we are putting in the atmosphere. The governemnt
                            also needs to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote alternatives. Plant-derived plastics,
                             biodiesel, wind power and solar power are all things that are a step in the right direction, but
                            governments need to enforce the limits on CO2 emissions for the polluting industries in their countries
                            for these to be effective. Also, individuals can play a part by making lifestyle changes. People should
                                try to buy cars with the best fuel economy, and only use their car when really necessary. They can also 
                                switch to energy companies that use renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Finally, small things like
                                 buying energy efficient light bulbs, turning off electricity in the house, and planting trees in the garden 
                                 can help.  </p>
